# 🔦 Lights-Out-Puzzle

An implementation of the classic "Lights Out" puzzle using C++ and Gaussian elimination in GF(2).

---

## 🧩 About

You are given a locked grid (SecureBox) with lights (on/off).  
The goal is to find the sequence of button presses that will turn off all the lights.

Each button toggles:
- Its entire **row**
- Its entire **column**  
*(excluding the center cell, which gets toggled 3 times → stays the same)*

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The puzzle is modeled as a linear system of equations:

```
A * x = b   (mod 2)
```

- `A` — matrix of influences (which button affects which light)
- `b` — current state of the grid (1 = on, 0 = off)
- `x` — solution vector: which buttons to press

The system is solved using **Gaussian elimination in GF(2)**.

## ✅ Features

- Clean matrix-based logic
- Fast and reliable solver
- Modular codebase (divided by logic and UI)
- Fully covered with unit tests
- Solves any N x N size grid


## 🧪 That has already been done:
---
--- works on sizes from `3x3` to` 100x100`
--- all tests pass - you can run through the terminal or at the Clion
--- works very quickly: large sizes
--- for milliseconds

---
This is my test

### 📥 How to set and run (Linux/macOS):

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Lights-Out-Puzzle.git
cd Lights-Out-Puzzle

# 2. We create a directory for assembly
mkdir build
cd build

# 3. We generate make files
cmake ..

# 4. Compile
make

# 5. Run (eg 5x5 box) Options are sure to be so not work
./Lights_Out_Puzzle 5 5 
```
